### Whenever you are looking for a specific Job or simply want to search for a job who is grouped in one category, you can always use the sub-lists available.

1. In the Jobs module, there are several sub-lists that shows the different jobs organized by status.

2. These sub-lists are available for all users and can be configured according to each agency, meaning you can add new sub-lists to help you organize your jobs view.

**By default you have the following sub-lists:**

- All - In the sub-list “All” you can see all the jobs that you are involved with.

- ClientRequests - In the sub-list "ClientRequests" you will see all the jobs requested by your clients.

- Closed - All the jobs that are closed are automatically moved to the sub-list "Closed".

- Delayed - In the sub-list “Delayed”, you may see all the jobs that are delayed. This means that the agreed date has passed and the Job is still not finished/closed.

- Mine - All jobs that are created by you will automatically appear on the sub-list "Mine".

- MyTeam - If you just want to check your Team's jobs, you will need to access the sub-list "MyTeam".

- Pending - In the sub-list “Pending”, you can see the jobs that need your attention and action. For instance, assigning a user or sending for approval.
