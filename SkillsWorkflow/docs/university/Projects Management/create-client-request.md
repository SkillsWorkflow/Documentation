From the client perspective, you can now create and control your own requests using Skills Workflow.

<h3>After collecting your credentials and logging in, the first step is to create your request.</h3>

1. For that you just need to access the Project you're involved with, create a new Job.

2. You are only going to have access to the Projects you're involved with.

<h3>After completing all the details, make sure you submit the post in order to create the Job.</h3>

- Once the Job is created, it will get a number that can be used as a reference.

- Don't forget to upload all the relevant information such as files, briefs, etc in order for the Account to be able to fully understand your request.

- Each Job you create represents a new request for the Agency. You can create as many jobs/requests as you need.

### Move the Job status

1. Once you activate the Job you will need to continue to move the Job Forward by changing the Job Status.

2. For that you just need to click on the Screen_Shot_2017-10-10_at_12.21.36.png symbol and select one of the available options.

3. Once you send the Job, the Agency will be able to review the request and Assign the team.

4. Please note that all approvals and adjustments should be registered under the same Job/Request. This way it would be easy to track all changes needed, and the history of each request.
