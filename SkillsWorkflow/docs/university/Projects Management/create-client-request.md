### After completing all the details, make sure you submit the post in order to create the Job.

- Once the Job is created, it will get a number that can be used as a reference.

- Don't forget to upload all the relevant information such as files, briefs, etc in order for the Account to be able to fully understand your request.

- Each Job you create represents a new request for the Agency. You can create as many jobs/requests as you need.
