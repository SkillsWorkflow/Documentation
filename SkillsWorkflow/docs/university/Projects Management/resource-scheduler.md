### The Resource Scheduler can be done in several ways

- You can add executors directly to the activity via the "Assign" option.

- Or you can use the resource calendar.


### In the resource calendar you have an overview of your team, assigned hours and availability.


Planning your resources helps you to make your availability more effective by monitoring your activities.

- On the left are all the resources you are responsible for.

- Users with no assigned activity may be monitored

- Using the filters at the top of the calendar, check information by employee, department, activity or date.

- Activities already assigned appear on the calendar by default

### Assign Activities 

- On your right side you can find all the activities to be assigned.

- Only planable activities appear in the list

- To define whether an activity is planable navigate to the activity's info tab and select "Planable".

- If you hover your mouse over the top of the activity, you can find a box with information about the activity, such as its stage, and end date.

- You can use the search box to find a specific activity that has not yet been assigned.

- The color of the activity indicates its step.

- To assign a specific activity, drag and drop the activity to the employee you want to assign to the defined dates..

- After assigning the employee, you can move the activity to lengthen or shorten its duration.

### Workload and availability

- The daily capacity of each employee is defined in advance on their file.

- After assigning an activity to someone, you can define how many hours a day that resource will be working on that activity.

- To do so press the box in the lower right corner of the bar and type the number of hours.

- The numbers at the top of each resource's bar represent its ability to fulfill assigned activities.

- The green color shows that the resource is available, and the red one that it is overloaded.

- To help you plan your resource availability, absences are also represented in the calendar.

- They are marked with a vertical blue bar in order to differentiate them from the activities.
