## My Tasks

### In Skills Workflow you can create tasks for yourself (if configured at your company).

- Tasks are regular jobs that behave a little bit differently throughout the system.

- They are created the same way as regular jobs but the workflow is usually much simpler (e.g. To Do> Done).

- They are also typically on a separate list for easier consultation.

### Create a new Task

1. To create a new Task, navigate to the "Projects" module.

2. Select the active Project where you want to include the new Task under.

3. Inside the Project's page click on the "+" sign and option "Job".

### Filling in the Task creation popup form. 

- **Title** - Name you would like to give to the Task.

- **Department** - Choose Task (this defines that this job is actually a task).

- **Type** - Type of task you want to create-

- **Start/End** - Choose when the Task starts and when it will end.

Once you complete all the fields click on the option 'check'.
