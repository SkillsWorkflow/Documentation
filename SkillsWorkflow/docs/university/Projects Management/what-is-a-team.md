- Whoever is on the team will have access to the information shared on the Project and/or Job
- The team members, depending on their role, should update the job description with the brief, keynotes from meetings, e-mails exchanged with the client and upload the relevant files (e.g. last versions of the final work/output)
- It is possible to define which teams have access to change the Start and End date of the Jobs.

The team is typically comprised by the following groups:

## Requester
The person who requests/creates the Job or Project
The Accounts involved in this job

## Responsible
The person who is responsible for supervising the job
Typically the department heads or client responsible

## Traffic
The person who assigns the creatives to each job
The person who controls the workload of creatives

## Executor
The person who executes the job, e.g. creatives, analytics, copywriters, strategists, etc.

## Finance
Finance team who has visibility on all jobs and is usually responsible for job closing

However, there is no exact definition for these groups as the team can be customized to have more or fewer groups as per the company's structure.

The names can also be customized based on company needs.

1. Each group plays a different part with a different set of responsibilities
2. For each phase of the process, a person may be able to move a job forward on the workflow or not, based on the group he or she belongs to
3. Each person knows what jobs depend on his or her own actions
