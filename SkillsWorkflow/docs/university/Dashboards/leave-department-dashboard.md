## 7. Leaves My Department Dashboard

When scheduling your own leaves or approving leaves submitted by your subordinates, it's important to know if other employees in the same department are also on leave. This prevents the department from being crippled due to a lot of employees being on leave on the same day.

This dashboard provides a calendar view showing which users from your Department are on Leave, for each working day of the calendar month.

To access, select "Leaves - My Department" from the Workspaces menu and the current month calendar will be displayed.
