When scheduling your own leaves or approving leaves submitted by your subordinates, it's important to know if other employees in the same department are also on leave. This prevents the department from being paralyzed due to many employees being off work on the same day.

This dashboard provides a calendar view that shows which users in your department are on leave, for each business day of the calendar month.


To access, select "Leaves - My Department" in the Workspaces and the current month's calendar will be displayed.
