## 4. Utilization Dashboard

Project Managers put a lot of effort on resource allocation. As much as possible, they want their team to be busy with tasks which are valuable to the agency (billable hours) as this will increase profitability. However, resource allocation becomes a challenge as the team grows when you have to assign resources to different projects all happening at the same time.

One of the easiest ways to check the effectiveness of your resource allocation effort is to track and analyze your team’s utilization. Skills Workflow have developed a Utilization Dashboard giving different views on how users time were spent across different dimensions. This will serve as a powerful tool to improve resource allocation.

The Utilization Dashboard can be accessed by selecting Workspaces from the menu bar then selecting Utilization:
