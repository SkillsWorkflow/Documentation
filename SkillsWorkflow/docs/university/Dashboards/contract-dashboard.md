## 3. Contract Dashboards

Dashboards are a powerful feature used to quickly support decisions related to a specific contract.

The goal is to give the user the ability to control processes in a very friendly and comprehensive way.

As a project manager, it is very useful to understand the status of a specific client and control the profitability of each project and contract. This way the PM will have the necessary tools to negotiate with their clients.

There are several dashboards at the Contract-level available in the system that will display different information.

Burn Dashboard

1. Select the contract you want to analyze.

2. Click on the "Burn Dashboard" tab.

3. Select the project you want to check.

You will find several representations that will show you in a glimpse whether your Contract is already burned.

Also, there's a summary representation that will show you the total planned, contracted, cost and income.

After selecting the project inside the contract you wish to analyze in detail, the system will give you the information of actual hours, actual cost, planned hours, planned income, contribution margin and contracted hours applied under that specific project.

The first representation works as a pivot table and shows you the planned time per typology group per deliverable (meaning the services you have previously sold/quote to your client)

It works as an Excel pivot table which allows you to re-organize your view if needed, adding information from the column chooser.

By default, you will be able to check per deliverable the number of planned hours, the related rate and the utilization percentage of a specific typology group.
