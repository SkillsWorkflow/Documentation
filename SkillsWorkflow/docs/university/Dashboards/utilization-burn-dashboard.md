Dashboards are a powerful feature used to quickly support decisions related to a specific contract.

The goal is to give the user the ability to control processes in a very friendly and comprehensive way.

As a project manager, it is very useful to understand the status of a specific client and control the profitability of each project and contract. This way the PM will have the necessary tools to negotiate with their clients.

There are several dashboards at the Contract-level available in the system that will display different information.
