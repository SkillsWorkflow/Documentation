## Create an Estimate

Estimates can either be linked to Fees or created directly under a Project or Job.

Should you wish to create an estimate associated to a specific Fee, please check our lesson 3 under contracts section.

To generate a estimate under a Project or Job you should navigate onto the document you wish to generate the estimate, press on the option + and choose "estimate"

To start building your Estimate details navigate on the Quotes tab where you will find 4 different sections:

- **Deliverables** - these are the services sold to the client (each line can represent actual deliverables, i.e. projects/jobs; a monthly fee, or any other structure you want to use for breaking down your Estimate.

- **Third Party Costs** - this is the first component of the estimate. These relate to external suppliers.

- **Expenses** - this is the second component of the estimate. Transportation, meals, hotel, are just some examples of expenses that can be estimated here.

- **Resources** - this is the final component of the estimate. Represents internal resources/man-hours being scoped for.
