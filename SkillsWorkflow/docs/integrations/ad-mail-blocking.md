All users that are on the Active Directory (AD) will have their e-mail access blocked if delinquent in the system.

The user has a tolerance period defined by the company, during which the user will be notified by email/push notifications.

- If the user is bound to AD and is delinquent, the access to e-mail will be revoked
- Users will not be allowed to send or receive e-mails
- However the AD account will not be blocked, being able to access into Skills Workflow
- In Skills Workflow, users will only have access to Timesheets and Leaves modules
- If the access to e-mail is blocked, the user should fill in his time.

To do so, user must go to Skills Workflow Login Page and Login with SSO.
