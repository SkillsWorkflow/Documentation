API URLs:

- API: https://integration-api-we.skillsworkflow.com/

You can try the API directly from the documentation, or you can use other application (e.g. PostMan) 

To use the API you will need to send 3 Headers in the request, as required in the documentation: X-AppTenant, X-AppId and X-AppSecret

You can also check our open source site and check some examples of using the API: https://github.com/SkillsWorkflow/api-demos

If you need to, please request the test (UAT) environment credentials for your Agency:

- X-AppTenant
- X-AppId
- X-AppSecret

The API is constantly evolving (but never having breaking changes):

- If you need something that you do not find in the API, do not hesitate to ask and we will analyze the feasibility of adding to the API
