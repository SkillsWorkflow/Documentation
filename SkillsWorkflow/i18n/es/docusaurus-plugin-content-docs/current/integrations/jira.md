The integration allows you to:

- Create Projects and Issues in Jira automatically
- Create Issues in Jira and import them automatically into Skills Workflow
- Sync Issues status in both systems automatically, no matter where you change them
- Comments in Jira are added automatically in Skills Workflow
- Teams in Jira are added automatically in Skills Workflow
- Navigate to the Issues in Jira from Skills Workflow


## Projects

When a Project is created in Skills Workflow, it is created in Jira automatically.

- You can control which Projects are sent to Jira

- If the Stage is moved in Skills Workflow, the status is update in the Jira Issue
- The due date set to the same, at all times, in the two systems
- Comments are sent to each system independently of starting place for the comment
