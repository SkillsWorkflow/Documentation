## Client Dashboards

Dashboards are a powerful feature used to quickly support decisions related to a specific client or project.

The goal is to give the ability to control processes in a very friendly and comprehensive way.

As a project manager is very useful to understand the status of a specific client and control the profitability of each project. This way the PM will have the tools to negotiate with their clients.

There are several Dashboards at the client level available in the system that will display different information.


### Burn Dashboard

The system will display several graphics with detailed information related to the selected project

You will be able to check total values for that specific project such as contracted hours, planned hours, actual hours, planned revenue, and actual cost.

Also, you will be able to find the burn percentage (planned - actual hours)

Project Time Burn

This representation will show you a monthly distribution of planned versus actual hours.

You will find out the same representation of the accumulated values as well.

Project Revenue Burn

This representation will show you a monthly distribution of planned revenue versus actual cost (based on user cost*actual hours).

You will also find out the same representation of the corresponding accumulated values
