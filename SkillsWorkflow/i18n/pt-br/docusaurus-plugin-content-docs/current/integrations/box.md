Skills Workflow integrates with Box.

The integration allows you to:

- Create automatically and organize a file structure in Box
- Access to the folders and files available in Box
- Let you team get quick and easy access to the files
- Share the direct link to the files

## Files

When a file is uploaded into Box, it is automatically available in Skills Workflow.

- You can share your file by going into your document and easily select the file
- It will be available to add it into the document's description
- Or to post it on document's feed

- Root
    - Client
    -   Project
        -   Jobs
        -   Sub-Jobs template
    -   Estimate
    -   Expense
-   User

## Synching
The synching is performed by a background process. Whenever a document is created or his folder name is changed in Skills Workflow, the process will replicate it in Box.

- The synching process is bi-directional
- Skills Workflow has a reference of the ID of the files and folders in Box
- The users will see the same file structure (starting on the root) in both systems
