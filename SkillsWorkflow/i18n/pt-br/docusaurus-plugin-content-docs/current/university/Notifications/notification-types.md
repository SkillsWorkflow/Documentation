Skills Workflow sends out two different types of notifications:

- E-mail notifications
- In-system notifications

Depending on their categories, notifications can have different periodicities:

- Immediate (every 5 minutes)
- Daily (once a day)
- Weekly (once a week)

Regardless of being immediate, daily or weekly notifications, all notifications are received in the system and can be sent via e-mail if the "Receive E-mail Notifications" flag is enabled on the user form.

## Immediate Notifications

The immediate notifications are received in the system over a span of time of up to 5 minutes. These are mostly about posts generated on a specific document and are of the following categories:

- Changes to workflow stages;
- Changes to document teams;
- Changes to document dates;
- Comments added to document feed;
- Tagging notifications on the document feed;
- Leave approvals/disapprovals;
- Timesheet disapprovals;
- Password resetting;

## Daily Notifications
The daily notifications are seen as a daily reminder to users. These are sent every day, at a specific time, according to what is set on the "Assistant Alert Time" field and calculated based on the "Default Time Zone" field in the back-office maintenance section.

These notifications are of the following categories:

1. Pending timesheet hours and tolerance days left;
2. Pending timesheet approvals;
3. Pending leave approvals;
4. Delinquency and blocking alert due to missing timesheet hours:
5. To the responsible regarding the resources they are responsible for;
6. To the resources themselves;
7. Blocking confirmation due to missing timesheet hours:
8. To the responsible regarding the resources they are responsible for;
9. To the resources themselves;

## Weekly Notifications
Leaves scheduled for the week after the current one:
According to the "Leaves Notification Week Day" configuration in the maintenance module of the back-office, the responsibles will receive one single notification on a specific day of the week informing which resources they are responsible for will be on leave on the following week;
