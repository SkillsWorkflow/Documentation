It is possible to create and manage contracts associated with specific projects and activities.

The estimate is at a higher level than the project, and allows you to bring together several projects in the same document.

The main objective is the creation of a contract, with the possibility of negotiation, where it is possible to register the number of hours sold and control the number of hours sold versus the number of real hours placed in various projects / activities belonging to a contract.

Contracts are associated with a specific client, and must be associated with a Price Table.
