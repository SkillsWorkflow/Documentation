## Lesson 1 - Create Rate Cards

Rate Cards are prices/costs for typology groups and/or users.

You can set multiple Rate Cards and Rate Cards columns in the same table.

### Rate Cards can be managed in two ways:

<h4>Sales values</h4>

- Add rates based on the sales values for a specific client(including margin and fixed costs).
- In this case, the bill's team does not need to include margin and fixed costs when creating rates.
- Some clients have a unique sales rate, which ensures that the bill's team doesn 't send different prices/costs to the same cliente.

<h4>Costs values</h4>

- Add rates based on the costs values for a user/typology group.
- In this case, bill's team will have to manage margin and fixed costs for the client.

### Create Rate Tables
